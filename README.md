# UFC Fight Predictor

UFC Fight Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict the outcomes of UFC fights based on historical data and fighter statistics.

## Overview

UFC Fight Predictor leverages machine learning techniques to analyze past UFC fight data and make predictions about potential fight outcomes. By considering various fighter statistics, historical performance, and other relevant factors, the model attempts to forecast the likely winner of a given matchup. Some key points about the UFC include the following:

1. **Founding and History:** The UFC was founded in 1993 by Art Davie, Rorion Gracie, and others. The organization was created to determine the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines.

2. **Ownership:** The UFC has undergone changes in ownership over the years. In 2001, Zuffa, LLC, led by brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, purchased the UFC. In 2016, the UFC was sold to the WME-IMG group, now known as Endeavor.

3. **Weight Classes:** The UFC features various weight classes, ranging from flyweight (125 pounds) to heavyweight (over 205 pounds for men, over 145 pounds for women). Each weight class allows fighters to compete against opponents with similar body weights.

4. **Events and Pay-Per-View:** The UFC organizes events regularly, which are typically broadcast on television and available through pay-per-view (PPV). Major events often feature championship fights and high-profile matchups.

5. **Championship Belts:** The UFC has titles for each weight class, and fighters compete for championship belts. Champions are determined through a combination of skill, performance, and ranking.

6. **International Expansion:** While originally based in the United States, the UFC has expanded globally, hosting events in various countries. The organization has gained a massive international fan base.

7. **Fighter Development:** The UFC has been instrumental in the development of MMA as a mainstream sport. Many of the world's top MMA fighters compete in the UFC, and it is often seen as the pinnacle of success in the sport.

8. **The Ultimate Fighter (TUF):** The UFC has a reality television series called "The Ultimate Fighter," where up-and-coming fighters compete for a UFC contract. The show has been instrumental in introducing new talent to the organization.

9. **Fighter Performance Institute:** The UFC has established the UFC Performance Institute, which provides training facilities, sports science, and medical support for UFC athletes. The institute is located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The UFC continues to be a major force in the world of combat sports, and its events attract a large global audience. It has played a crucial role in the growth and mainstream acceptance of mixed martial arts.
